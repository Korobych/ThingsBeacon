# ThingsBeaconDebug
App for International Contest World-IT 2017/18
The main idea is using iBeacon technology on the iOS devices (iPhone, iPad) to provide blind or visually impared people 
an opportunity for searching for the left bag or any personal item. 
This is the main aim of this project. 
** Option 1** By using another iOS device as a broadcaster we can catch a Bluetooth signal from the
this device (by our own iOS device with preinstalled app running in Recieve mode). By that we know the distance between two
devices. Max estimated detection distance approx. 50m.
-------------------------------------------------------
** Option 2** By using an original iBeacon Bluetooth LE (low energy) accessory with much higher power and max-distance 
potential in comparison with and iOS device as an iBeacon. As in the previous option we would know the distance between
two devices.
** Option Extra ** It's also possible to use an iWatch or other smartwatch (it's still questionable) instead of typical
iOS device (Recieve mode).
